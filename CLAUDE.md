# CLAUDE.md — H→ZZ→4μ BDT (Run3 2022 postEE)

Project guide for Claude Code. Read this first.

**Update this file when making significant changes to the codebase (new files, architecture changes, new dependencies, changed conventions).**

## Project goal

Train a binary classifier (signal vs background) on H→ZZ→4μ events using
Monte Carlo samples at √s = 13.6 TeV. Input samples are NanoAOD-style ROOT
files produced by the companion [madgraph](https://github.com/Siun-Kim/madgraph)
pipeline (MadGraph5 + Pythia8 + Delphes).

## Phases

| Phase | Output | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1. Skim   | flat parquet ntuples in `data/ntuples/`            | DONE |
| 2. Features | engineered columns appended to the ntuples        | DONE |
| 3. Train  | xgboost model in `data/models/`, training plots     | DONE — `bdt_v1.json` (17 mass-free feats) is the recommended model. |
| 4. Evaluate | ROC, feature importance, overtraining check, m4l-vs-score 2D | DONE |
| 5. Planing | `bdt_v3_planed.json`, mass decorrelation study | DONE — planing alone did not hit the \|r(score, m4l)\| < 0.1 target. |

## Environment

- **Python**: 3.10+ via venv. See `requirements.txt`.
- **GPU usage**: xgboost `tree_method='hist'` with `device='cuda'` if a GPU is
  visible. Falls back to CPU silently.
- **No ROOT dependency** — uproot reads NanoAOD directly.

## Data

### Signal
- `ggH_ZZ_4l` — ggH → ZZ → 4μ (HEFT, LO)

### Background
- `qqZZ_4l` — qq̄ → ZZ → 4μ (irreducible)
- `DY_M50` — Z+jets (reducible)
- `TTto2L2Nu` — tt̄ dilepton (reducible)

Sample paths, cross sections, and luminosity are configured in
`config/samples.yaml`. **Do not hardcode paths in scripts.**

## Selection (HZZ standard, simplified)

See `config/selection.yaml` for the canonical values. Summary:

- HLT: OR of `HLT_TripleMu_10_5_5_DZ`, `HLT_TripleMu_12_10_5`,
  `HLT_DoubleMu4_3_LowMass`, `HLT_Mu17_TrkIsoVVL_Mu8_TrkIsoVVL_DZ_Mass3p8`
- 4 muons, charge sum = 0, all loose ID + relIso < 0.35
- Build Z₁ (closest to mZ, mass ∈ [40, 120]), Z₂ (mass ∈ [12, 120])
- 70 < m₄ℓ < 1000 GeV (training window)
- pT thresholds: leading μ > 20, subleading > 10, others > 5

## Features

Phase 2 produces these columns from the skim. The **training input list lives
in `src/features.py::FEATURES`** and is a strict subset: mass columns are
stored for diagnostics but not fed to the BDT.

Stored columns:

- Mass: `m4l`, `mZ1`, `mZ2`  *(diagnostic only — NOT in `FEATURES`)*
- Kinematics: `pt4l`, `eta4l`, `pt_Z1`, `pt_Z2`, `dR_Z1Z2`
- Per-lepton: `pt_mu1..4`, `eta_mu1..4` (sorted by pT)
- Ratios: `pt_Z1/m4l`, `pt_Z2/m4l`
- Helicity angles: `cos_theta_star`, `cos_theta1`, `cos_theta2`, `Phi`, `Phi1`
  (5 HZZ angular discriminants — see arXiv:1208.4018 for definitions)

`m4l`, `mZ1`, `mZ2` are excluded from `FEATURES` to keep the BDT score
decorrelated from the Higgs mass peak.

#### Mass decorrelation via planing — negative result

Phase 5 attempted to push |r| < 0.1 by adding mass features back to FEATURES
and reweighting each class to a flat m4l distribution at training time
(per-class 1/density, 50 bins in [70, 250] GeV).

Result: |r| went **up** monotonically from v1 → v2 → v3 as more
m4l-correlated information entered the training pipeline. Planing flattens
the *marginal* m4l density per class but the BDT still reads m4l through
joint splits with `mZ1+mZ2 ≈ m4l`, pT scales, and helicity angles.

**Recommendation**: `bdt_v1.json` (17 mass-free features, no planing) is
the best of the three on decorrelation **and** the most stable. For tighter
decorrelation, practical next steps are: (1) keep only helicity angles +
per-lepton η; (2) DDT-style flattening; (3) DisCo / adversarial training.

The planing implementation is kept in the repo for reference
(`config/selection.yaml::train.planing.enabled`).

## Conventions

- All paths via `pathlib.Path`, never string concatenation.
- Use `awkward` arrays end-to-end in skim; convert to `pandas`/`numpy` only at
  the train.py boundary.
- Save intermediates as **parquet** (not ROOT, not pickle).
- Random seed: 42 everywhere. Set in one place (`src/utils.py::SEED`).
- Logging: `logging` module, INFO level by default. No `print()` in src/.
- Plots: matplotlib, save as PNG (300 dpi) to `plots/`. Never call `plt.show()`.

## Cross sections (13.6 TeV, used for MC weighting)

| Sample          | σ (pb)  | Notes |
|-----------------|---------|-------|
| ggH→ZZ→4l       | 0.00637 | σ(ggH) × BR(H→ZZ→4l), all flavors |
| qqZZ→4l         | 1.39    | full ZZ→4l |
| ggZZ→4l         | 0.0148  | optional, often folded into qqZZ k-factor |
| DY M>50         | 6225    | inclusive |
| TT 2L2Nu        | 98.04   | dilepton |

## Common gotchas

1. **Negative MC weights**: `genWeight` can be negative for amcatnlo samples
   (DY). Use `np.sign(genWeight)` for normalization, not just sum.
2. **NanoAOD muon collection**: `Muon_pt`, `Muon_eta`, etc. — flat arrays
   indexed by event. Use `awkward` to handle the jagged structure.
3. **Z pairing ambiguity**: with 4 same-flavor muons, there are 2 valid OS
   pairings. Pick the one where Z₁ is closest to mZ.
4. **PU reweighting**: not applied. Known omission for this MC-only study.

## Known limitations

- MC only — no collision data.
- No PU reweighting or lepton scale factors.
- Reducible backgrounds (DY, tt̄) produce 4μ only through fakes, which
  Delphes models poorly.
- LO cross sections throughout.
